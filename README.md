# AI Pathfinder – Uninformed Search Visualization

GOOD PERFORMANCE TIME APP is an interactive AI Pathfinder developed.

This project demonstrates how different Uninformed Search Algorithms explore a grid environment to find a path from a Start node (S) to a Target node (T).

Instead of directly jumping to the result, the program visually shows how the algorithm works step-by-step:
- Which nodes are explored
- Which nodes are in the frontier
- How the final path is constructed

It also supports dynamic obstacles that may appear during runtime. If the path becomes blocked, the algorithm automatically re-plans a new path.

##  Objective

- Implement 6 uninformed search algorithms
- Animate search process step-by-step
- Compare performance differences
- Handle dynamic obstacles
- Re-plan path if blocked

---

##  Algorithms Implemented

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** – Finds shortest path in unweighted grid.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** – Explores deeply before backtracking.
3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** – Expands lowest cost node first.
4. **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)** – DFS with fixed depth limit.
5. **Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)** – Repeated DLS with increasing depth.
6. **Bidirectional Search** – Searches from both start and target.
